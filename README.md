# JUnit 5 Gradle Jacoco Test

This repository contains a small Java project using the Gradle build system together with JUnit 5,
 Jacoco, and JDK 10.
It exists just for testing purpose and to remind me of the configuration settings without 
searching the whole Internet again and again.
Feel free to use it for your own projects.
